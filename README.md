Main.cpp = Code deployed to ardiuno to collect data (Contains raw data no conversion)

Easy_Graphing.py = New updated graphing that directly takes data and applies conversion allowing for 4 channel sensing (Remember to close serial plotter before accessing through python)

Capa_Data.py = Code used to filter the data collected (Will combine with easy graphing soon)
